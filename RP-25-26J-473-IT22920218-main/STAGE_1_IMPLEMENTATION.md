# STAGE 1: Backend Metrics & State Upgrade - COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive per-road metrics collection and exposure via API/WebSocket without modifying traffic signal logic or emergency preemption.

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/controller/state_models.py`
**Changes:**
- Added `RoadMetrics` class with 8 metrics per road
- Added `RoadMetricsSet` class aggregating metrics for all 4 roads
- Extended `StatusResponse` to include `metrics: RoadMetricsSet` field
- Maintains backward compatibility (existing fields unchanged)

**New Data Structures:**
```python
class RoadMetrics(BaseModel):
    waiting_count: int = 0
    avg_wait_time: float = 0.0
    cleared_last_interval: int = 0
    arrival_rate_vpm: float = 0.0
    departure_rate_vpm: float = 0.0
    time_since_last_green: float = 0.0
    congestion_percent: float = 0.0
    eta_clear_seconds: float = 0.0
```

### 2. `backend/controller/sumo_connector.py`
**Changes:**
- Added vehicle state tracking infrastructure:
  - `vehicle_waiting_times`: Dict[Road, Dict[vehicle_id, accumulated_seconds]]
  - `vehicle_in_edge`: Set of vehicles currently on each edge
  - `arrival_history`: Sliding window of arrival timestamps
  - `departure_history`: Sliding window of departure timestamps
  - `last_green_time`: Tracks when each road last received green signal
  - `cleared_last_interval`: Vehicles exiting during last decision cycle

- Added configuration constants:
  - `MAX_QUEUE_PER_ROAD = 40` vehicles
  - `WAITING_SPEED_THRESHOLD = 2.0` m/s

- New methods:
  - `_update_vehicle_tracking()`: Updates per-vehicle waiting time and arrival/departure counts
  - `compute_metrics()`: Computes all 8 metrics per road using:
    - Current vehicle states from SUMO
    - Historical tracking data
    - Queue discharge rate estimation
  - `_get_opposite_road()`: Helper for tracking NS/EW greens
  - `_time_sec` property: Alias for backward compatibility

- Enhanced `set_green_phase()`: Updates `last_green_time` when green signal is set
- Enhanced `reset()`: Clears all tracking data on simulation reset

**Metric Computation Details:**

1. **waiting_count**: Vehicles with speed == 0 OR speed < 2.0 m/s
2. **avg_wait_time**: Mean of accumulated wait seconds for waiting vehicles
3. **cleared_last_interval**: Count of departures from edge in last decision cycle
4. **arrival_rate_vpm**: Vehicles entering per minute (60-second sliding window)
5. **departure_rate_vpm**: Vehicles exiting per minute (60-second sliding window)
6. **time_since_last_green**: Current_time - last_green_time for this road
7. **congestion_percent**: min(100, (waiting_count / MAX_QUEUE_PER_ROAD) * 100)
8. **eta_clear_seconds**: waiting_count / max(discharge_rate, 0.1)

All computations are defensive:
- Division by zero protection
- Use of max/min bounds
- Exception handling for TraCI queries

### 3. `backend/app_sumo.py`
**Changes:**
- Added imports: `json`, `datetime`, `RoadMetricsSet`
- Added metrics logging path: `backend/data/logs.jsonl`
- Added `_log_metrics()` function:
  - Logs metrics to JSONL (one entry per line)
  - Includes timestamp, simulation time, all metrics, and signal state
  - Defensive error handling
  
- Modified `_run_loop()` simulation loop:
  - Step 3: Call `sumo_connector._update_vehicle_tracking()` to update state
  - Step 5: Call `sumo_connector.compute_metrics()` to get metrics
  - Step 8: Include metrics in `StatusResponse`
  - Step 9: Log metrics every decision_cycle (5 seconds)
  - Maintains all existing logic unchanged

**API/WebSocket Output:**
- `/api/status` now includes `metrics` object:
  ```json
  {
    "time": 15,
    "counts": {...},
    "queues": {...},
    "signal": {...},
    "emergency": {...},
    "decision": {...},
    "metrics": {
      "north": {
        "waiting_count": 5,
        "avg_wait_time": 12.45,
        "cleared_last_interval": 2,
        "arrival_rate_vpm": 18.5,
        "departure_rate_vpm": 15.2,
        "time_since_last_green": 8.0,
        "congestion_percent": 12.5,
        "eta_clear_seconds": 3.25
      },
      "east": {...},
      "south": {...},
      "west": {...}
    }
  }
  ```

- WebSocket `/ws/live` broadcasts same enhanced `StatusResponse` with metrics

**Logging:**
- Location: `backend/data/logs.jsonl`
- Format: One JSON entry per line (JSONL)
- Frequency: Every 5 seconds (decision cycle)
- Entry structure:
  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2026-01-04T15:30:45.123456",
    "simulation_time": 15,
    "metrics": {...},
    "signal": {"green_road": "north", "remaining_seconds": 3}
  }
  ```

### 4. `backend/controller/traffic_controller.py`
**No changes required** - Metrics computation is independent from decision logic.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Vehicle Tracking**: Implemented per-road dictionaries to track vehicle IDs and their accumulated waiting time. This allows accurate average wait time computation.

2. **Sliding Windows**: Arrival/departure rates use 60-second sliding windows for smoothed metrics that reflect recent traffic patterns.

3. **Green Time Tracking**: Records when each road receives green to compute time_since_last_green. NS/EW roads updated together (realistic for 4-way junction).

4. **Defensive Programming**:
   - Division by zero: Use `max(value, minimum)` bounds
   - Missing data: Default to 0 or skip vehicles that fail SUMO queries
   - Exception handling: Wrapped all TraCI calls

5. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - StatusResponse defaults `metrics` to empty RoadMetricsSet
   - All existing fields preserved and unchanged
   - No changes to decision logic

6. **Performance**:
   - Metrics computed every simulation step
   - Logging only on decision cycle (5x less frequent than computation)
   - Efficient set operations for tracking arrivals/departures

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Validate Metrics Output**:
   - Run simulation and verify `/api/status` includes metrics object
   - Check WebSocket broadcasts include metrics

2. **Validate Calculations**:
   - Waiting count: Manual verification against SUMO GUI
   - Avg wait time: Should increase over time in congested conditions
   - Congestion %: Should reach 100 when queue exceeds MAX_QUEUE_PER_ROAD

3. **Validate Logging**:
   - Check `backend/data/logs.jsonl` is created
   - Verify entries are valid JSON (one per line)
   - Confirm logging occurs every 5 seconds

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing frontend should still work unchanged
   - Existing decision logic unchanged
