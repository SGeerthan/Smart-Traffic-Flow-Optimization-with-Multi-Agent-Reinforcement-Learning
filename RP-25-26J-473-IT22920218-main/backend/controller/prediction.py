"""
Traffic prediction module for short-term forecasting and heavy traffic detection.

Provides lightweight, explainable predictions without ML:
- Queue trend analysis (increasing/stable/decreasing)
- Arrival rate forecasting (10s, 30s horizons)
- Heavy traffic probability heuristic
- Congestion level classification
- Predicted ETA to clear queue
